Web development is a broad field that involves creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses various technologies, languages, and frameworks to build web-based solutions. Here's some information about web development and the types of projects commonly undertaken in this field:

Front-End Development:

Front-end developers work on the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of websites and web applications.
They use technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing web pages.
Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js are often used to build complex front-end applications.
Back-End Development:

Back-end developers focus on server-side logic, databases, and the overall functionality of web applications.
Common back-end technologies include programming languages like Python, Java, Ruby, and frameworks like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Django.
They work on managing data, user authentication, and server-side processing.
Full-Stack Development:

Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end development, allowing them to work on all aspects of a web project.
They often use a combination of technologies to build complete web applications.
